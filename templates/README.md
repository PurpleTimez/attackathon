# Attack Templates

This directory contains template code that can be used for your attack.
Feel free to change it however you like, or not use it at all! 

We currently have support for: 
- [Golang](/golang)

A "copy and run" script is provided for each template, which will: 
* Copy the code in your working directory into the `flagship` container
* Update `run.sh` with execution commands (if not already present)
* Run `./run.sh` inside of the container
